-Initially set up everyone with Notepad++ on their machines. Generally available from USB keys as ITB won't allow
	.exe downloads. Perhaps explain the general difference between a text editor and a word processor.

-Have students create a folder on desktop to contain all content done in the classes.
-create a sub folder for "lessons" (another will be made later to hold their website)

-Save a blank new file as html in their newly created folder to enable text highlighting.
-Create a "hello world" web page


-Topics for discussion: (No need to get bogged down in too much detail)
	-What is a browser?
	-What is a webpage/website?
	-What is HTML and CSS?
	-What is an opening/closing tag?

-Introduce simple tags: (CSS will be introduced in second class, for now, inline styling or style tags will do)
	<html>

	<head>
	<title>
	<style>

	<body>
	-heading tags <h1> -> <h6>
	<p>
	<img>
	<br>
	<a>
	
I would recommend showing some very simple styles if time allows such as background colour/text size/text colour.

At the end of the 2 hours, the student should:
	-understand a little about how their web browser works
	-know how to create a blank html page
	-understand what a tag is/is used for
	-understand the basic sections (head/body) of the page and their use
	-how to add tags mentioned above to their page (allow them some time and freedom to play with styles/sizes of 
	 page elements. Helps to get used to things)
