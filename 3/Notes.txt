This class should take a step back from learning specific tags and looks at the CSS side of things.

This will include:

Moving from using style tags to a seperate CSS file.
Learning about parent child relationship between tags.
Block vs Inline elements.
Tag attributes.
CSS classes, ids and tag names.

If time permits, color values(hex/rgb)/block element sizes(height and width px / %).

This class will allow the next class of layout using the <div> tag easier.
